npm install -g rrproject

# RRProject
This is a CLI tool built to speed up dev time on projects. I found myself using the same set of files every time I started a new project.

### Usage
1. Install the package globaly `npm install -g rrproject`
2. Restart your terminal / cmd and run `rrproject -v` to ensure its working
3. Now you can run `rrproject <project-name>` and follow the prompts
	- This will create a directory with the project name you entered.

#### TODO:
- [ ] Add ability to use a link to download boilerplate zip
- [ ] Compress (zip) boilerplates in lib
- [ ] Add wordpress boilerplate

I plan to add more boilerplates to the tool as soon as I find out which ones I need. The more features the better so feel free to open up an issue on github with the feature request.

Its currently pretty catered to my projects but I hope to have more people's boilerplates added so we can all benifit.
